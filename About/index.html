        I've spent a lot of energy trying to answer this question. It's part of
        the reason I studied physics, and partly what keeps me curious about the
        world. I believe the more I understand the world, the more I understand
        my context in it, and ultimately the more I learn about myself. I am not
        my education, my projects or my experiences, those things are just
        symptoms of what I am: curious.

        Curiosity has always been my number one motivator. It is part of what
        makes me who I am. Naturally, this means that whenever I have nothing
        else to do, I find myself learning something new. After graduating high
        school, I didnt know what I wanted to do, so I took a gap year. During
        that gap year I started teaching myself physics and fell in love with
        physics. Now, having just finished my physics degree, I am in a similar
        situation. I don't know what my future holds, yet I have found myself
        again learning and falling in love with programming and data science.
        Learning is part of who I am and even if I wanted to I don't think I
        could ever stop.

      <h2 id="comfort-title">Get Out of the Comfort Zone.</h2>
      <p id="comfort-text">
        The comfort zone is my worst enemy, as cheesy as that sounds. I went
        through something traumatic in high school that made me retract into
        myself. I noticed that the more I neglected to do difficult things, the
        more things became difficult. I reached a point where even going to the
        convenience store was a scary prospect, despite not having a problem
        doing things like that just a few months before. It was a difficult
        cycle where the more I gave in to fear, the smaller my comfort zone
        became. I reached a point where I decided that I wasn't going to let
        this anxiety rule my life any more and made an effort to do more
        difficult things. I found that as I did more difficult things, the less
        difficult they became and I had reversed the cycle. Now I have no
        problem doing things I never would have thought myself capable of
        before, like running a marathon, or backpacking alone through Europe.

        The future is uncertain. What with the pandemic, climate change, and the
        technological singularity looming in the not-so-distant future, the next
        few decades are going to be nothing like anyone has seen before. The one
        certainty is that technology and data are going to have an increasingly
        important role in our lives, for better or for worse. I want to be part
        of this industry not only because it fascinates me but because if I can
        take part in technological advancement, I might be in a position to help
        steer it towards the better instead of the worse.
