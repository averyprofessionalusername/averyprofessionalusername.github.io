          <p>
            This project was an excersize in teaching myself the basics of
            object-oriented programming. It was also a chance to use some of the
            physics I learned at unversity in a way that showcases my
            programming progress and how I can apply what I alreay know.

          <img src="prj_img/AirHockey.png" alt="" />

          <p>
            I made a two player Air Hockey game usig PyGame. The most
            challenging part of this project was programming how the puck
            bounces off of the border. The puck would get stuck and bounce back
            and forth on the border because I had the puck's velocity reverse
            when it hit the border. I fixed this by always having the puck
            bounce back away from the border, depending on which border it was
            rather than having the same functionality for all the borders.

          <h1>Ski Jumping Analysis</h1>
          <img src="prj_img/sk_img.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The sport of ski jumping is characterized by a discrepancy in
            performance of individuals from different countries. Athletes from a
            set of countries (mostly european countries and japan) consistently
            outperform those from the other countries. Ski Jumping Canada
            noticed this and I volunteered my data analysis skills to help them
            determine the root causes of this discrepancy so that they may
            compete at a higher level on the world stage.

          <h1>Predicting Bitcoin</h1>
          <img src="prj_img/BTC.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            This ongoing project is an opportunity to use some of the math I
            learned at university, along with some of what I've learned about
            data analysis since to find patterns in bitcoin price data. This
            project taught me to find a balance between listening to the data
            and using my intuition. I've had to rethink how I've looked at this
            problem a few times but now I may have found some useful patterns in
            the data.

          <p>
            This school project was my first experience outside of a physics lab
            using large data sets to make predictions. This project was my first
            experience making code that focussed on readability and rigorous
            testing. Code for analysing data in physics labs usually doesn't
            need to be readable or tested as long as it gets the job done. This
            was the first time I had to think about how other people could read
            and apply my code and it permanently changed the way I write code
            for the better.

          <p>
            I built this website to teach myself the basics of front end web
            development. I didn't use any frameworks and just coded everything
            using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to learn
            exactly how these languages work and complement each other.

          <img src="prj_img/flyswatimg.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Just building a static website didn't give much opportunity to learn
            much JavaScript, so I added a little game. Making this game was an
            opportunity to reapply what I learned making little games in PyGame
            in a new language. It was also my first experience making menu
            screens. This forced me to think about the exapandability of my code
            in a way I hadn't before.
